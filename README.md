### Healthcheck ###
The healthcheck runs every minute to check if Clamd and Freshclam are still running.
Script `healthcheck.sh` will be responsible for this. It checks if both processes are present using `pgrep`.

### Usage ###
Every startup the container will run freshclam to download the latest definitions available.
After a successfull download, freshclam and clamd are started as daemon.
Both programs print there output to console.

Every hour freshclam checks for new definitions.
